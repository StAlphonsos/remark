={ remark - lazy, sleazy plain text markup }================================
  This is remark, attila's lazy, sleazy plain text markup system.
==[ Remark ]================================================================
  The idea is simple: turn a file that looks more or less like this one
right here into DocBook XML, and thence into whatever the hell you want.
Remark supports popping out PS, PDF, and DVI output right now, with the help
of some external tools.  RTF is easily possible, and HTML is coming.
=====< Building Remark >====================================================
  Remark uses the standard perly build system fu:
  _$ perl Makefile.PL_
  _$ make_
  _$ sudo make install_
  If this does not work for you, please let me know.  I should beef up my
dependency checking a bit, to make sure that jade or openjade is installed,
at least, but right now, I don't check.  Also, if you are a BSD user, then
you might not like Makefile.PL installing stuff into /usr/bin and /usr/lib
instead of /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/lib, in which case I recommend:
  _$ perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/usr/local INSTALLDIRS=site_
  instead.  This will force remark into /usr/local, as Pan intended.  Other
than that, there's not much to installing remark.
=====< Emacs vs. The World >================================================
  I am an Emacs person.  This means that all of this stuff is slanted
towards Emacs users, but it's all perfectly usable by others.  It's just
that the actual process of typing the text up is a bit easier if your editor
understands all the magic goobers that appear e.g. at the bottom of this
file (and in the template).
  If you *are* an Emacs person, then those goobers are very handy.  They
configure your buffer such that hitting Meta-Q (fill-paragraph-or-region)
does the right thing: as long as you indent your paragraphs with two spaces
at the start, your text will stay pretty, and all of the section boundaries
will be obeyed.
  It's also a good idea to get into the habit of ending sentences with two
spaces.  Besides being good form, it also makes the sentence-based movement
operators (Meta-A, Meta-E) work properly.
=====< Processing Text >====================================================
  The remark man page describes things fairly completely; you can also
view this same information with the command
  _$ remark -H | more_
  You'll notice in the text above that I used underscores to set off some
text that should be in a computer font, and that I've used stars to set
off text that should be emphasised.  You can also use dollar signs, which
I intend to be used for equations ala TeX, but it doesn't quite do all
the right stuff yet... feel free to pitch in!
  In any event, if you just point remark at a text file with no other
arguments, it will turn it into DocBook XML:
  _$ remark README_
  will turn this file into README.xml.  From there, you can do whatever
you like, but remark knows how to do some additional post-processing,
via the _-R_ option:
  _$ remark -R ps README_
  will turn this file into README.ps, by using the _jade_ (or _openjade_),
_jadetex_ and _dvips_ programs, in that order.
=====< Bugs and Contributions >=============================================
  Bugs reports and contributions are always welcome.  Please email them to
attila@stalphonsos.com with [remark] in the subject, so that my automatic
spam filters (go go gadget bmf! go go gadget procmail!) will know to leave
it alone.
  There should be a TODO file in the tarball that has a list of things that
I would like to work on when I have time to spare.  If you want to pitch in,
please let me know first, because I may have already started, and it would
be a waste to have us both doing the same thing without coordinating.
